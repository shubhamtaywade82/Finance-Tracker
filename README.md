Assignment 1
ASSIGNMENT:

1. Create a new rails application called finance-tracker. I'm using Rails 6 for this application and I'd recommend you use the same (Installation videos for Rails 6 can be found in sections 13, 14, 15 depending on your system).

2. Change directory into your finance-tracker folder and ensure that the rails server runs and you are able to preview the app.

3. Make a commit of your newly created app files to your git repo, the message should be "Initial commit of app" (ensure you do this from the finance-tracker directory).

4. Update the readme file to say something relevant about the app. Example: "This is the finance tracker app from the Complete Ruby on Rails Developer course".

5. Make a commit of your code (to capture this latest change).

6. Create a Github repository for the application and push your code to the remote repo.

Old notes on Rails 6 installation (shouldn't be an issue if you have been using Rails 6 already):

- Make sure to install yarn (which will require node installed already) which will help you install and manage JavaScript packages/dependencies. It's like npm (node package manager).

- Rails 6 makes use of webpack via the webpacker gem. Webpack provides modularization for JavaScript and the webpacker gem provides integration with webpack. All this will start making sense when we start using these in our app to install and use Bootstrap. Just know that if you start seeing requirements for node or yarn during installation of Rails 6 (which will try to install webpacker as well) don't worry, just install what it recommends and that's really it! Good luck!
